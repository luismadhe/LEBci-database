This dataset contains EEG signals used in the paper "Brain-computer interface system based on p300 processing with convolutional neural network, novel speller, and low number of electrodes"


This dataset contains EEG signals acquired from 8 subject, which were recording using the device Cyton
OpenBCI®. The sample rate is 250 Hz and the electrode channels positions are O1, Oz and O2. The paradigm
to elicit the P300 wave is the DonchinC described in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-020-09744-2
